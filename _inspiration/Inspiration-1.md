quote: 'So that''s my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New
  Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody''s ever made before.
  Don''t freeze, don''t stop, don''t worry that it isn''t good enough, or it isn''t
  perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.'
