quote: I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes.Because if you are making
  mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing
  yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never
  done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something.So that's my wish for
  you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing
  mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before.
