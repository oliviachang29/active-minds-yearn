title: My Blackness Can Never Die.
subheading: ''

---

**_My Blackness can never die._**

Even though you lock us up.

Tears dropping from my eyes,

saying, “I can’t breathe” but you still deny

to release me.

**_My Blackness can never die._**

Even though I survived 9 months of pregnancy:

the pain, the swelling.

Yet the only time I couldn’t survive was

the first time

I was going to see my beautiful Black daughter.

Black skin.

Beautiful, young, Black queen.

**_My Blackness can never die._**

Even when my Blackness is taken away.

Locked up, lost soul

trying to figure out when I will be able to go home.

The world would never try to find me.

The only hope I have is my mother’s Black soul

wanting to find her Black daughter

with a Facebook post.

“Help find the Black girl with the nappy curls.

Big nose. With full lips, thick thighs, big, brown, round eyes.”

Yet the only time I ever saw an Amber Alert,

was for someone else’s milk-skinned, blonde-headed, daughter.

**_My Blackness can never die._**

Even when the world looks and stares at me.

My college degree—

the only thing I learned was how to follow their lead.

White professors, white students, white university.

I realized my Blackness is

viewed

as if I'm from a different universe in this university.

**_My Blackness could never die_.**

Blacking out because of my blackness.

**_My Blackness could never die._**

Even when you’ve found ways to kill,

destroy, and belittle me.

**_My Blackness could never die._**

Because this Black heart, Black soul, Black mind, Black skin

will never be silenced.

**My Blackness WILL NEVER DIE.**
