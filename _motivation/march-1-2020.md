quote: “Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others. Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.”
author: Winston Churchill
